"tw_user_analyzer.sh" is used to extract following and follower from Twitter Accounts and generate analysis charts.

This script is based on twurl and Twitter API, so you need to register a Twitter Developer Account first and create a project.

Get twurl from here "https://github.com/twitter/twurl"

This tools support multi-processes, if you have more than one twitter accounts, you can use twurl to register them on your twitter project.

"twurl accounts" will show you all registered accounts
